This is my final project in a text based gaming format.

Hardest part was figuring out how to heal but not over a certain point so that the player could have infinite health.

Choose a class to play as and fight battles against numerous enemies. Every outcome can be changed by fighting or healing at certain points in the match.
Each class has different stats.
After the first game you can choose to play again.
